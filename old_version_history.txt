#Error Log

#1.2 ALPHA

# Fatal error encountered 11/14/17
# When reading file to dictionary, error as follows:

#Traceback (most recent call last):
#  File "/home/pi/python_games/highscor1.2.py", line 76, in <module>
#    settings[settings] = settings_file[settings]
#  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/shelve.py", line 111, in __getitem__
#    value = self.cache[key]
#TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'

#May have something to do with way dictionaries were wrote back to
#files. See lines 155-163

#In the meantime, just create a deleteme file to handle rewriting
#stuff directly to files to be able to access the files (files
#will likely be destroyed after each run)

#However, don't worry. It's only a flesh wound.

#STATUS: Fixed! I accidentally typed settings where I needed setting.



#1.3.3

# Non-fatal error encountered 11/25/17
# When mixing scores of multiple different lengths, the sorting
# function dosen't work as expected.
# It appears to concatenate the tuple elements and then sort them.
# Going to leave it until the next update to fix.
# Note to self : The not-always numbers setting dosen't sort well...
# Will include a warning about that in the UI.
