# High-Score
Programs that save high scores to a file. Original program by Micheal Dawson.

I originally programmed this without git, so the opening comments still have some of the version history. 
The program works by shelving files with the highscores in them and retriving them when nessecary (actually only once at the start of the program; they're re-shelved only when the user chooses "save and quit".)


Also, version 2.0 was stopped in development and contains no changes to the code. The file marked v1.3 has the current version.
