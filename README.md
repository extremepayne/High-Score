# High-Score
Programs that save high scores to a file. 

This program was created originally as a response to the fact that the games on my calculator didn't have a good way to save highscores, and the eventual hope is that it will be able to have games write higscores to it (while still allowing manual addition of scores).

The basic idea is that you add games, scores, and associate those scores with players. Additional functionality has also bee added, including settings, viewing scores by player as well as by game, and so forth. 
The program works by shelving files with the highscores in them and retriving them when nessecary (actually only once at the start of the program; they're re-shelved only when the user chooses "save and quit".)

##Versioning explaination
The project was originally programmed without git, so the opening comments still have some of the version history. 
Also, version 2.0 was stopped in development and contains no changes to the code. The file marked v1.3 has the current version.


##Contributions
More than welcome! Please check out the code, it really isn't that long of a program. Submit any thoughts or suggestions you have via the approriate channels.
