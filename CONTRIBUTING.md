# Contributing

## How?
There are two ways to contribute:
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

### PRs
These are for anything you *can* fix. (Esp. typos.)
If you see a typo, a bug you can fix, or a feature you can add, please do so.

This repo uses [black](https://github.com/ambv/black), an auto-formatter, for its code style 
and [standard README](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme), a template, for its README style. Please comply to these styles.

Here's how to do it: [Github flow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-flow).

### Issues
These are for anything you *can't* fix.
If you see a bug or a feature that should be added, create a new issue.

If you have a suggestion for a CI app or a coverage app, please start an issue!

Here's how to do it: [Creating an issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue).
